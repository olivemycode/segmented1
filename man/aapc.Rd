\title{
Average annual per cent change in segmented trend analysis
}
\description{
Computes the average annual per cent change  to summarize piecewise linear relationships in segmented regression models.
}
\usage{
aapc(ogg, parm, exp.it = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95, wrong.se = TRUE, 
    .vcov=NULL, .coef=NULL, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{ogg}{ the fitted model returned by \code{segmented}. }
  \item{parm}{ the \emph{single} segmented variable of interest. It can be missing if the model includes a single segmented covariate. If missing and \code{ogg} includes several segmented variables, the first one is considered.}
  \item{exp.it}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, the per cent change is computed, namely \eqn{\exp(\hat\mu)-1}{exp(mu)-1} where 
  \eqn{\mu=\sum_j \beta_jw_j}{mu=\sum j bjwj}, see `Details'.}
  \item{conf.level}{the confidence level desidered.}
  \item{wrong.se}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, the `wrong'' standard error (as discussed in Clegg et al. (2009)) ignoring 
  uncertainty in the breakpoint estimate is returned as an attribute \code{"wrong.se"}.}
    \item{.vcov}{ The \emph{full} covariance matrix of estimates. If unspecified (i.e. \code{NULL}), the covariance matrix is computed internally by \code{vcov(ogg,...)}.}
  \item{.coef}{ The regression parameter estimates. If unspecified (i.e. \code{NULL}), it is computed internally by \code{coef(ogg)}.}
  \item{...}{further arguments to be passed on to \code{vcov.segmented()}, such as \code{var.diff} or \code{is}.}

}
\details{
 To summarize the fitted piecewise linear relationship, Clegg et al. (2009) proposed the 'average annual per cent change' (AAPC)
 computed as the sum of the slopes (\eqn{\beta_j}{beta_j}) weighted by corresponding covariate sub-interval width (\eqn{w_j}{w_j}), namely 
 \eqn{\mu=\sum_j \beta_jw_j}{mu=sum_j beta_j w_j}. Since the weights are the breakpoint differences, the standard error of the AAPC should account
 for uncertainty in the breakpoint estimate, as discussed in Muggeo (2010) and implemented by \code{aapc()}.
  }
\value{
  \code{aapc} returns a numeric vector including point estimate, standard error and confidence interval for the AAPC relevant to variable specified in \code{parm}.

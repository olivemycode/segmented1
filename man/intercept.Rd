\title{
  Intercept estimates from segmented relationships
}
\description{
Computes the intercepts of each `segmented' relationship in the fitted model.
}
\usage{
intercept(ogg, parm, rev.sgn = FALSE, var.diff=FALSE,
    .vcov=NULL, .coef=NULL, digits = max(4, getOption("digits") - 2),...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{ogg}{
     an object of class "segmented", returned by any \code{segmented} method.
}
  \item{parm}{
the segmented variable whose intercepts have to be computed. If missing all the segmented variables in the model are considered. 
}
%  \item{gap}{
%  logical. should the intercepts account for the (possible) gaps? 
%}
 \item{rev.sgn}{vector of logicals. The length should be equal to the length of \code{parm}, but it is recycled otherwise.
  When \code{TRUE} it is assumed that the current \code{parm} is `minus' the actual segmented variable,
    therefore the order is reversed before printing. This is useful when a null-constraint has been set on the last slope.
 }
  \item{var.diff}{Currently ignored as only point estimates are computed.
  %logical. If \code{var.diff=TRUE} and there is a single segmented variable, the computed standard errors 
  %  are based on a sandwich-type formula of the covariance matrix. See Details in \code{\link{summary.segmented}}.
    }
\item{.vcov}{ The \emph{full} covariance matrix of estimates. If unspecified (i.e. \code{NULL}), the covariance matrix is computed internally by     \code{vcov(ogg)}.}
\item{.coef}{ The regression parameter estimates. If unspecified (i.e. \code{NULL}), it is computed internally by \code{coef(ogg)}.}

 \item{digits}{controls number of digits in the returned output.}
   \item{...}{ Further arguments to be passed on to \code{vcov.segmented}, such as \code{var.diff} and \code{is}. See Details in \code{\link{vcov.segmented}}.}
 
 }

\details{
  A broken-line relationship means that a regression equation exists in the intervals 
  `\eqn{min(x)}{min(x)} to \eqn{\psi_1}{psi1}', `\eqn{\psi_1}{psi1} to \eqn{\psi_2}{psi2}', and so on.
  \code{intercept} computes point estimates of the intercepts of the different regression equations 
  for each segmented relationship in the fitted model.
}
\value{
\code{intercept} returns a list of one-column matrices. Each matrix represents a segmented relationship.
